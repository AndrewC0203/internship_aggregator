# Decisions

Formal record of GATED architecture/design decisions. See CLAUDE.md for the protocol —
Claude drafts Problem/Options, I write Decision/Reason/Tradeoffs myself.

## Decision 1: Backend language & framework

Problem: Need a language and web framework for the ingestion pipeline, adapters, and
search API.

Options considered:

1. TypeScript + Fastify — schema validation built in, plugin architecture, matches
   prior projects (FitOS, Muscle Map, arb scanner)
2. TypeScript + Express — largest ecosystem, no built-in validation/typing
3. TypeScript + Hono — modern, edge-compatible, smaller community
4. TypeScript + Next.js API routes — fullstack in one app, awkward fit for a
   persistent background scheduler
5. Python — would reinforce the concurrent CS-fundamentals roadmap, but unfamiliar

Decision: TypeScript + Fastify

Reason: Typescript familiarity, and schema built in + modern framework

Tradeoffs accepted: More familiarity with express / next.js

## Decision 2: Database

Problem: Storage for companies, jobs, sources, and refresh run history, queried by
both the API and the refresh job concurrently.

Options considered:

1. PostgreSQL — relational joins, built-in full-text search, requires running an instance
2. SQLite — zero-config, file-based, weaker at concurrent writes (API reads while
   refresh job writes)
3. MongoDB — schema flexibility for raw ATS payloads, weaker at the relational joins
   this project needs

Decision: PostgreSQL

Reason: Familiarity with postgres, relational database seems better for now until we verify the shape of data, better for large scale operations

## Tradeoffs accepted: N/A, clear

## Decision 3: Queue / scheduler

Problem: Something needs to re-run the ingestion pipeline on a schedule and handle
retries/failures per source.

Options considered:

1. Cron + polling — zero new infra, retry/concurrency logic hand-written
2. BullMQ + Redis — real job queue, built-in retry/backoff/concurrency limiting,
   failure dashboard (Bull Board), adds a Redis dependency
3. Managed cron (GitHub Actions / Railway) — no infra to run, coarser retry control,
   logs live outside the app

Decision: BullMQ + Redis

Reason: New framework, handles retries and limiting + better dashboard and similar time besides a small learning curve

Tradeoffs accepted: Simpler with cron + polling, and costs money

---

## Decision 4: Deployment target & service structure

Problem: Where and how the app runs while building, and whether frontend/backend are
one deployable unit or two.

Options considered:

1. Local only, single service (Fastify serves both API and built frontend) — simplest,
   no CORS, but the daily-refresh success metric goes untested until deployed
2. Cloud from day one — forces scheduling/env/logging to get solved early, setup
   overhead before any pipeline code exists
3. Hybrid — build locally, deploy just the scheduler early
4. Monorepo, separate frontend/backend packages — independent deploys, but two
   origins, needs CORS, more moving parts solo

Decision: Local-first, single service

Reason: Simplest to deploy at first, can setup later once get working product

Tradeoffs accepted: Harder to test metrics, need to figure out how to deploy later

---

## Decision 5: Data model / schema normalization

Status: NOT YET DISCUSSED — needed before Phase 1 adapters are built.

Problem: Greenhouse, Lever, and Ashby each return differently-shaped job data
(postedAt vs createdAt vs publishedDate, different field names for location, comp,
grad requirements, etc). Need a strategy for unifying them into one schema.

Options considered:

1.
2.
3.
